# USPTO Rule Pack

Rules effective date: 2026-06-15. Verify current USPTO/eCFR/MPEP sources before filing or relying on any legal position.

### Claim format (37 CFR 1.75; MPEP 608.01) — drafting rules the agent enforces
- One sentence per claim, ending in a period; preamble + transitional phrase (`comprising` open;
  `consisting of` closed) + body of limitations.
- **Antecedent basis:** introduce an element with `a`/`an` on first mention, refer back with
  `the`/`said`. Every `the X` needs an earlier `a X` in the same claim (or an ancestor claim).
- Independent vs dependent: MVP supports single-dependent claims only. Multiple-dependent claims
  are legally possible but unsupported here; fail loud / route to practitioner tooling rather than
  drafting one silently.
- Mirror the inventive kernel across statutory categories where applicable (apparatus / method /
  system / computer-readable medium).
- 112(f): a `means for` / nonce-word (`module/mechanism/unit for`) limitation invokes
  means-plus-function and REQUIRES corresponding structure in the spec, or it is indefinite (112(b)).

### 101/102/103/112 — analysis as FLAGS + QUESTIONS for a human (never conclusions)
- **101 (eligibility):** Alice/Mayo two-step. Flag abstract-idea risk; check the claim recites a
  practical application / concrete structure. Do not opine on eligibility.
- **102 (novelty):** element-by-element — anticipation = every limitation in ONE reference. Each
  prior-art chart cell must be quote-backed with page/paragraph/location and human-verification state.
  ALSO run a statutory-bar screen from the INTERVIEW (on-sale, public use, the inventor's own disclosure, with
  dates vs the effective filing date and the one-year grace window) — these are not found by search.
- **103 (obviousness):** apply the Graham factors and name the relevant KSR rationale (MPEP 2143 A-G):
  (A) combine prior-art elements by known methods for predictable results; (B) simple substitution of one
  known element for another; (C) use a known technique to improve a similar device the same way; (D) apply
  a known technique to a known device ready for improvement; (E) obvious-to-try among a finite set of
  predictable solutions; (F) design incentives / market forces prompting a known variation; (G) teaching,
  suggestion, or motivation (TSM). Capture secondary considerations (commercial success, long-felt need,
  unexpected results) from the inventor as rebuttal.
- **112:** (a) written description / enablement — each limitation traced to spec support; (b)
  definiteness — terms of degree need an objective bound; (f) means-plus-function structure.
- Output is flags and `questions_for_attorney` / `questions_for_inventor`, never an opinion or FTO/
  validity/infringement conclusion.

### Information Disclosure Statement (37 CFR 1.97/1.98; SB/08)
- Seed the IDS from the `evidence/` index. Each reference must be HUMAN-VERIFIED (real title/venue/
  link) before listing — the hardened prior-art verification stage records discloses-vs-lacks.
- The duty is CONTINUING: newly-found material references must be disclosed within the 1.97 windows.
- As of Jan 2025 there is a size-based IDS fee; surface it from the dated fee schedule, do not hardcode.
